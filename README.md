scoreFetch
==========

A simple program to 'fetch' current NHL and NBA scores, as well as download todays Backhand shelf podcast

sfV1.0 cannot currently be interpreted, I am working on the GUI currently, and it still needs a lot of work.
version .7 does work right now and uses the terminal to display scores. 

For Score Fetch to work properly on Windows, ANSI colors must be enabled. This is NOT TESTED and I cannot
ensure that it will work, only in theory will it work.
