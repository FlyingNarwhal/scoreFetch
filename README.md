scoreFetch
==========

A simple program to 'fetch' current NHL and NBA scores

sfV1.0 does not currently compile, I am working on the GUI currently, and it still needs a lot of work.
version .6 does work right now and uses the terminal to display scores. 

For Score Fetch to work properly on Windows, ANSI colors must be enabled. This is NOT TESTED and I cannot
ensure that it will work.
